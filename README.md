<h3>What we do</h3>

Cumulo is an active member of the community of validators in blockchain networks. In some of them, he also manages the Spanish user communities in different channels such as Telegram or Discord. Another great value he brings is the generation of content in Spanish for these communities.

We take blockchain participation one step further, sharing our research, content, technical support and dissemination with the community of each project.

A technical profile with extensive experience in technology teaching and writing technical manuals added to a great creative talent with knowledge and experience in community management, marketing and development.
